# TODO LIST
***
This project is made to be evaluated in the final instance of module 4, to Fronted Development career, dictated by the institution ADA. This project is based on the creation of an application to manage tasks, with the knowledge acquired in the course of module 3 about javascript. To carry out this project HTML was used, the Tailwind framework was used for CSS and React.js

## Web page sections
- **HEADER:** App title
- **INPUTS:** In this section is the input that will allow us to write the name of a new task that we want to add to the task list, together with the add button. And on the other hand there is the select with the options that will allow us to filter the tasks, whether they are complete, incomplete or all of them.
- **TASK LIST:** In this section is the list of tasks that we were creating. Each task has the possibility of marking or unmarking depending on whether we want to show it as complete or not, and a button to permanently delete it from the list.
